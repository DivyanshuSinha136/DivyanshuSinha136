## 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate **developer, innovator, and problem solver** who loves building things from scratch — from **AI systems** to **operating systems**.  
I started my journey with Python and quickly expanded into **C, C++, JavaScript, Assembly**, and **system programming**.  

Some highlights of my journey:
- 🧠 Developed **AI systems** from scratch (rule-based AI, Python-based AI backends, and even Assembly-based AI)
- 📦 Published Python packages on **PyPI** (including `pythonaibrain`, an AI backend with self-learning capabilities)
- 🖥 Built my own **programming language** — *KingCobra* — with custom syntax, compiler, and `.kb` extension
- 🛠 Working on **Peacock OS**, a lightweight experimental operating system
- 🔐 Skilled in **ethical hacking**, **security software**, and **encryption systems**
- 🎮 Developed **games and simulation engines** (including 3D asset handling and train simulations)
- 📚 Built **educational software** (like my Class 12 Physics Interactive GUI program)
- 🌐 Created **secure web applications** with encryption, OTP verification, and real-time features
